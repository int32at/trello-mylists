# trello-mylists
Chrome Extension for Trello that only shows lists and cards that are relevant to me

##Installation
"Load unpacked extension" from the Extensions menu and select the `trello-mylists` directory. That's it.

##Usage
To activate the `trello-mylists` feature, simply filter your cards using the "me" filter - by pressing `q`. 
Trello, by default, will now filter and display all cards which have been assigned to you (or which you subscribed)
and hide the others. 

Lists with no cards that are relevant for you will continue to show - `trello-mylists` will hide those for you!
You will only see lists and cards which need your attention!

By pressing `q` again, the filter is not activated anymore and everything will be back to normal.
